## 🧠 Why `talk2dom`

In most automated testing or LLM-driven web navigation tasks, the real challenge is not how to click or type — it's how to **locate the right element**.

Think about it:

- Clicking a button is easy — *if* you know its selector.
- Typing into a field is trivial — *if* you've already located the right input.
- But finding the correct element among hundreds of `<div>`, `<span>`, or deeply nested Shadow DOM trees? That's the hard part.

**`talk2dom` is built to solve exactly that.**

---

## ✨ Philosophy

> Our goal is not to control the browser — you still control your browser. 
> Our goal is to **find the right DOM element**, so you can tell the browser what to do.

---

## ✅ Key Features

- 🔁 Persistent session for multi-step interactions  
- 🧠 LLM-powered understanding of high-level intent  
- 🧩 Outputs: actionable XPath/CSS selectors or ready-to-run browser steps
