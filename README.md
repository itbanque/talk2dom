## 🧠 Why `talk2dom`

In most automated testing or LLM-driven web navigation tasks, the real challenge is not how to click or type — it's how to **locate the right element**.

Think about it:

- Clicking a button is easy — *if* you know its selector.
- Typing into a field is trivial — *if* you've already located the right input.
- But finding the correct element among hundreds of `<div>`, `<span>`, or deeply nested Shadow DOM trees? That's the hard part.

**`talk2dom` is built to solve exactly that.**

---

## 🎯 What it does

`talk2dom` helps you locate elements by:

- Extracting clean HTML from Selenium `WebDriver` or any `WebElement`
- Formatting it for LLM consumption (e.g. GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Returning minimal, clear selectors (like `xpath: ...` or `css: ...`)
- Playing nicely with Shadow DOM traversal (you handle it your way)

---

## 🤔 Why Selenium?

While there are many modern tools for controlling browsers (like Playwright or Puppeteer), **Selenium remains the most robust and cross-platform solution**, especially when dealing with:

- ✅ Safari (WebKit)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Mobile browsers
- ✅ Cross-browser testing grids

These tools often have limited support for anything beyond Chrome-based browsers. Selenium, by contrast, has battle-tested support across all major platforms and continues to be the industry standard in enterprise and CI/CD environments.

That’s why `talk2dom` is designed to integrate directly with Selenium — it works where the real-world complexity lives.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install talk2dom
```

---

## 🔍 Usage Example

### Basic Usage

By default, talk2dom uses gpt-4o-mini to balance performance and cost.
However, during testing, gpt-4o has shown the best performance for this task.

#### Make sure you have OPENAI_API_KEY

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

#### Sample Code

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

from talk2dom import get_element

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("http://www.python.org")
assert "Python" in driver.title
elem = get_element(driver, "Find the Search box")
elem.clear()
elem.send_keys("pycon")
elem.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)
assert "No results found." not in driver.page_source
driver.close()
```

### Free Models

You can also use `talk2dom` with free models like `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` from [Groq](https://groq.com/).

#### Make sure you have a Groq API key
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="..."
```

### Sample Code with Groq
```python
# Use LLaMA-3 model from Groq (fast and free)
elem = get_element(driver, "Find the search box", model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile", model_provider="groq")
```

### Full page vs Scoped element queries
The `get_element()` function can be used to query the entire page or a specific element.
You can pass either a full Selenium `driver` or a specific `WebElement` to scope the locator to part of the page.
#### Why/When use `WebElement` instead of `driver`?

1. Reduce Token Usage — Passing a smaller HTML subtree (like a modal or container) instead of the full page saves LLM tokens, reducing latency and cost.
2. Improve Locator Accuracy — Scoping the query helps the LLM focus on relevant content, which is especially helpful for nested or isolated components like popups, drawers, and cards.

You don’t need to extract HTML manually — `talk2dom` will automatically use `outerHTML` from any `WebElement` you pass in.
#### sample code

```python
modal = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "modal")
elem = get_element(driver, "Find the confirm button", element=modal)
```

## ✨ Philosophy

> Our goal is not to control the browser — you still control your browser. 
> Our goal is to **find the right DOM element**, so you can tell the browser what to do.

---

## ✅ Key Features

- 📍 Locator-first mindset: focus on *where*, not *how*
- 🧠 Built for LLM-agent workflows
- 🧩 Shadow DOM friendly (you handle traversal, we return selectors)
